What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

  * Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive is an agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services serving to improve the behavioral health of the U.S. by reducing the impacts of mental illness and substance abuse. SAMHSA conducted the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2015, which includes statistics on the effects of illicit drug use, alcohol, and tobacco on mental health issues for U.S. civilians ages 12 and older. The study also analyzes mental and substance abuse disorders and their treatments.

  * The Tax Policy Center provides statistics and analyses on tax policies for the public and the policymakers. The alcohol rates dataset contains taxation data for each state from multiple years (2013-2017, 2010, 2006-2008, 2003-2004, and 2000). The format is that of an excel file and in a table with horizontal breaks for each type of alcohol. A challenge will be wrangling the data into a cleaner format for our models and visualizations.

  * The Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) is a data catalogue created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation with a mission to improve the health of human populations around the world by providing datasets on population health. This data source was introduced to us through this class, which contains data that is easily obtainable in a format that is very simple to clean and manipulate. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 dataset will act as a great dataset to examine the outcomes of alcohol abuse by demographic features like age and gender.

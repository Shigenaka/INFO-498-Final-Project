"Table 20. Pain Reliever Use Disorder in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2015 and 2016 NSDUHs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Pain Reliever Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for pain reliever dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Prescription psychotherapeutic subtypes were revised in 2016; one effect was the comparability of codeine products between 2015 and 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
